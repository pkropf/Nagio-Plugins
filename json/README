The check_json plugin will pull json data from a web server and
evaluate it to determine how services on the remote system are
working. 

As an example, hostname.py is a simple CGI program that returns the
host name of the system on which web server is running as a json data
structure. It can be used by check_json to ensure that the host name
of the web server doesn't change.
